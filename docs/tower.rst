Nextflow Tower
==============

**Nextflow Tower** it is a browser based graphical interface that allows users to manage, monitor and launch Nextflow pipelines both on-premises
and in the cloud.

.. Note::
    Tower offers an a open source free version and a commercial one. The main difference between them is that the latter enables you to launch and manage
    pipelines on premises (e.g. your institutional HPC) while the latter does not, or at least not in the same manner (you will need to run a daemon 
    in your system called `Tower Agent <https://help.tower.nf/22.2/agent/>`_). 

On this tutorial, we will show how to use the run the nf-core pipeline using the free version of Tower.

First, you need to access the `tower.nf <https://tower.nf/>`__ website and login.
